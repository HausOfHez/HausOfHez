- 👋 Hi, I’m Hez!
- 👀 I’m interested in psychedelic fungi strain research and building my future strain consulting business. I also enjoy playing & DMing RPGs, and my homebrew worldbuilding is often inspired by repos from this amazing community. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning remedial Git functionality to optimize my various Obsidian vaults and begin properly tracking changes on the business website I've been building.
- 💞️ Soon I’ll be looking to collaborate about my business ideas, but if there's any RPG homebrew I'm able to share, I will.
- 📫 How to reach me - hez at shroomchooser dot com 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a pre-GUI internet user who first started messing around online in 1982. No computer science training here, just a BA in English.
